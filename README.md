Sorting_Visualizer - A web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms.

1. Implemented algorithms:

1.1) Bubble sort
1.2) Selection sort
1.3) Insertion sort
1.4) Merge sort
1.5) Quick sort
1.6) Heap sort

2. Colored representation of step being executed:

2.1) Blue:default 
2.2) Yellow: Being compared 
2.3) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved 
2.4) Green: In correct position

3 Controls for visualizations: 

3.1) Speed of visualization (5 speed levels) 
3.2) Array size () 
3.3) Generation of new array values (Randomly generate new data).

Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
